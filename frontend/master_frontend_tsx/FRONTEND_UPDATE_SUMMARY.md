Backend (getAllRegistrations) 
→ Frontend (getTuitionStatus)
→ Combine with semester list
→ Display with status-based UI
```

### Semester Timeline:
- **HK1_2023, HK2_2023**: Historical data ✅
- **HK1_2024**: Current semester with data ✅
- **HK2_2024 → HK1_2027**: Future semesters (not opened) 🔒

## 🚀 Features Ready

1. **Complete semester overview** from 2023 to 2027
2. **Real-time calculation display** from backend
3. **Status-aware UI** with appropriate interactions
4. **Detailed course breakdown** with fees
